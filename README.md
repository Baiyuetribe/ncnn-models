##  <p align="center"> ncnn models </p>

The collection of pre-trained AI models, and how they were converted, deployed. [中文](README-CN.md)

### About

The ncnn framework enables cross-device deployment with the help of the vulkan api. We pre-train models via pytorch, tensorflow, flying paddle etc. and then convert them to ncnn models for final deployment on Windows, mac, linux, android, ios, WebAssembly and uni-app. However, model conversion is not a one-click process and needs to be handled manually. In order to extend the boundary applications of ncnn, we have created this repository to receive any cases of successful or failed conversions.
